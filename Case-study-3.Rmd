### Introduction


  As the 2020 election nears, Joe Biden (former Vice President under the Obama administration) and Donald Trump (current President) are neck and neck in the polls. This means that the outcomes of swing states -- states where the two major political parties have similar levels of support among voters--  will be pivotal in determining our next president and the Senate Majority. North Carolina has 15 out of the 538 votes in the electoral college and is historically a swing state. In 2008, Barack Obama (Democrat) won North Carolinaâ€™s votes by a margin of 0.3 percentage points; in 2012, Mitt Romney (Republican) won the vote by 2 percentage points, and in 2016, Trump (Republican) won the vote by 3.6 percentage points (1). There are 13 congressional districts within North Carolina, so each district gets one vote in the electoral college as the 2 state senators get one vote each, totalling 15 votes. Three out of the 13 congressional districts are currently represented by Democrats, and the remaining 10 by Republicans. However, some of these districts have been known to vote the same as the entire country (i.e. if a Democrat is leading the race these districts tend to vote democrat and vice versa) (2). 

	Voting polls, which predict who will win the presidential, senate, and house of representative elections and predict what margin they will win by, are constantly updated prior to the races. The issue with polls, however, is that the margin of error is typically very large, and the samples are not representative of the true population of voters (3) . In the 2016 polls, Hillary Clinton was predicted to win by a large margin. After that did not occur, the public is more weary to trust early voting polls.

  An alternate method to predict who will win these races is predicting who will show up to the polls and then using this information combined with records of how these voters have voted in the past to predict the election outcomes. We aim to use North Carolina voter registration data and historical records of which of those registered voters actually did vote in the 2016 and 2018 elections to predict which voters will vote in North Carolina in 2020. 

  In Section 2 of our report we will present and describe the data we used in these predictions along with the exploratory data analysis we conducted. In Section 3 of our report we explain how we handled missing data and present the methods we used to create our logistic regression prediction model. In Section 4 we provide the results of our logistic regression model. In Section 5, we speak to the validity of our model and the sensitive analysis that we conducted and finally, in Section 6, we discuss limitations and further investigations.
